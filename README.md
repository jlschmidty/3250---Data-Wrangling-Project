# 3250---Data-Wrangling-Project

**Tuesday, December 17th**

## Introduction

This project will analyze trends within the top 250 highest-rated IMDb films. The analysis will focus on various factors such as ratings, genres, directors, and release years to uncover patterns and correlations that contribute to a movie's success.

## Data

### IMDb Top 250 Movies

The dataset used for this project is the IMDb Top 250 Movies dataset available on Kaggle. It includes information about movie titles, release years, genres, directors, and IMDb ratings.

### Data Collection Challenges

Initially, the plan was to scrape data from Rotten Tomatoes to complement the Kaggle dataset. However, due to difficulties in scraping data from Rotten Tomatoes, the focus shifted to the IMDb Top 250 dataset, which was successfully scraped using Selenium.

### Data Merging Issues

While attempting to merge the IMDb data with other datasets, it was found that there were not enough movies for a comprehensive analysis. This led to the decision to find a more suitable dataset on Kaggle that could be effectively joined with the IMDb data.

## Analysis

The analysis will explore correlations between various attributes using scatterplots, boxplots, histograms, and bar charts. Key areas of focus include:

- The relationship between IMDb ratings and worldwide box office sales.
- The influence of directors on movie ratings.
- The impact of movie budgets on box office performance.
- Genre trends and their influence on box office success.

## Conclusion

This project aims to provide a foundation for understanding the factors that contribute to the success of films. By examining the IMDb Top 250 dataset, we hope to uncover valuable insights that can inform future research in the field of film studies.

## Instructions

The Python notebook for this project should be run in order, starting with `01` and proceeding sequentially through `02`, `03`, etc.
